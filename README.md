# Sparta Global Data 22 Final Project

This project consists of a package that creates an ETL pipeline for the Sparta Global Academy.

The pipeline extracts the following data from an Amazon S3 data lake:<br>

<ol>

<li>
    Academy Data - This has data on Spartans and the different courses they have made it into. <br>
</li> 
<br>
<li>
   Talent Data - This has data on all applicants from Sparta Day as well as information on whether they have passed tests or not. <br>
</li> 
<br>
<li>
    Sparta Day - This is data collected from the applicant that has made it to the Sparta Day event. <br>
                Applicants undertake phychometric tests and presentations and are scored on performance. <br>
</li> 
<br>
<li>
    Applicants - This data on applicants who have applied to join a course with Sparta Global.
<ul>

</ul>

</li> 

</ol>

Extracted Data from Amazon S3 is transformed within our program and then loaded into MongoDB in order to be able to analyse the data. <br>

With this project, users will be able to query and analyse the newly created database within MongoDB in order to get a single customer view of the newly transformed data. <br>

Users will also be able to use the newly transformed data within MongoDB Atlas' data visualisation tool to perform analysis and/or create dashboards.
